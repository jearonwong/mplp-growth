  "content": "Fair question. A few differentiators:<p>On open source: tools like Vault, Doppler, or Infisical are excellent but require setup, maintenance, and infra (or their hosted tier). KeyEnv&#x27;s value prop is zero infra — install the CLI, run `keyenv run -- your-command`, done. For small teams that don&#x27;t want to manage secrets infra, it&#x27;s faster.<p>On hyperscalers: AWS Secrets Manager &#x2F; GCP Secret Manager work well at scale but have per-secret pricing that adds up, and the DX friction is non-trivial (IAM, SDK calls, region config). We&#x27;re optimized for developer teams who want CLI-first access without cloud-specific lock-in.<p>On pricing: the per-user model is intentional — it stays predictable as the secret count grows. You&#x27;re right that at very high secret counts hyperscalers win on cost. We&#x27;re not competing there; we&#x27;re competing on simplicity for teams of 2–20 devs.<p>Not a fit for every team — just trying to make the tradeoffs honest.",
