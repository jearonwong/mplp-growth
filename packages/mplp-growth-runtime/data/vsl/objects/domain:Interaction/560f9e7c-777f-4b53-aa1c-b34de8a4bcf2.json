  "content": "&gt;IMO the security pitchforking on OpenClaw is just so overdone.<p>Isn&#x27;t the whole selling point of OpenClaw that you give it valuable (personal) data to work on, which would typically also be processed by 3rd party LLMs?<p>The security and privacy implications are massive. The only way to use it &quot;safely&quot; is by not giving it much of value. Maybe for some open source project where everything is public anyway, but then why does it need to take over the whole device?",
