W3C-style tracing. Git-like state snapshots..\n\nI'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how MPLP (Multi-Agent Lifecycle Protocol) could complement CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)'s work in serving developers.\n\nBest regards,\nMPLP (Multi-Agent Lifecycle Protocol) Project\nhttps://mplp.io",
