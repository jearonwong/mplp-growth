  "content": "Yes, the open-source release he did is what introduced me to Miranda.  I rewrote a lot of my previous Haskell solutions to Advent of Code puzzles with it, and liked it so much I decided to try to improve on it ;-)<p>That&#x27;s what led to Admiran.  I originally wrote Admiran in Miranda, then bootstrapped from that to self-hosting when it was stable enough to do so.  The original Miranda combinator compiler &#x2F; interpreter took 20 minutes to compile all of Admiran, while the self-hosted version now takes 20 seconds.<p>One of the grad students of David Turner has taken up maintenance on the original Miranda source; the repository is now at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;DATurner&#x2F;miranda\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;DATurner&#x2F;miranda</a>",
