That person has to follow South Dakota laws, and those laws can require whatever South Dakota regulators want, including sign-offs by professional engineers.<p>If you&#x27;re a South Dakota resident signing up for a web portal, the company may have no knowledge of your jurisdiction specifically (and it would be a huge loss for the world if we moved to a &quot;geo-block every single country by default until you clear it with your lawyers&quot; regime). That portal may very well be hosted in Finland by a German hosting company, with the owners located in Sweden, running Open Source software primarily developed in Britain. It&#x27;s possible that no single person affiliated with that portal&#x27;s owner ever stepped food in your jurisdiction.",
